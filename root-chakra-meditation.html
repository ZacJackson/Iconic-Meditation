				<h2>
					Creating a solid foundation
					for your life.
				</h2>
				<p class="article-text">
					How can you feel safe, stable,
					and grounded when the world
					around you feels
					unpredictable? It sounds like
					a paradox with no solution.
					But it doesn't have to be that
					way!
					<br /><br />
					The root chakra is our solid
					foundation for balance in
					life; without it opened we
					will struggle to make any
					progress on the journey
					upwards.
					<br /><br />

					In Eastern philosophies, this
					energy center is said to be
					located at the very bottom of
					the spine and coils around all
					other 7 chakras even though
					they are not in physical
					alignment.
					<br /><br />

					Balancing your root chakra
					creates a new sense of faith
					in life's upsets so that they
					don't bring you down and make
					you feel discouraged and
					unwilling to live life
					completely.
					<br /><br />
				</p>
				<h2>
					Opening your root chakra with
					meditation
				</h2>
				<p class="article-text">
					The root chakra is the first
					of 7 major chakras in our
					body, and it's all about
					grounding. It's also called
					the base or foundation, and
					it's responsible for keeping
					us grounded to Mother Earth.
					<br /><br />
					Many of us are not feeling
					grounded and full of energy.
					We may be struggling to feel
					calm, or we may be
					experiencing a low mood.
					<br /><br />

					This is often because our root
					chakra is not open which means
					we don't have enough life
					force flowing through us. In
					this blog post I'm going to
					show you how to open your root
					chakra so that you can get
					more life force flowing
					through your body!
					<br /><br />

					The root chakra is also the
					foundation of our energy
					system and governs how we
					receive energy from others.
					<br /><br />

					When you have your root chakra
					open, you are in a place where
					you can really feel what's
					going on with other people.
					<br /><br />

					You’re also more able to take
					care of yourself because it
					allows for self-honoring,
					self-love, and willingness to
					be alone in solitude.

				<ul class="key-points">
					<li>
						<span
							class="key-points-bold"
							>Step one:
						</span>
						The root chakra is
						located at your base
						of the spine and it
						affects our sense of
						personal power,
						security, grounding
						and physical energy.
						<br />
						<br />
						The first step in
						opening this chakra
						is to find a
						comfortable position
						on the floor with
						legs crossed as
						close to your body
						as possible.
						<br />
						<br />
						You should be
						cross-legged with
						both feet tucked
						under you (or one
						foot if that's
						uncomfortable).
						<br />
						<br />
						Place your hands
						palms up on either
						side of your hips
						and take 3 deep
						breaths focusing on
						letting go of
						negative thoughts
						from head to toe.
						<br />
						<br />
					</li>
					<li>
						<span
							class="key-points-bold"
							>Step two: </span
						>Turn your attention
						to the base of the
						spine. This is where
						your root chakra is
						located. Notice any
						tightness in around
						the base of your
						spine. <br /><br />
						Since the root
						chakra element is
						fire, imagine that a
						bright red glowing
						light like an ember
						from a fire is
						bringing warmth to
						your entire being.
						Hold the thought for
						as long as you can
						and when you drift
						just keeping coming
						back to that same
						thought.
						<br /><br />let go
						of any negative
						thoughts that envoke
						feelings of fear. Be
						present and try to
						stay focused on the
						base of your spine
						and the bright red
						glowing light.
					</li>
					<li>
						<span
							class="key-points-bold"
							>Step
							three: </span
						>Do this for as long
						as you like
						(preferably for at
						least five minutes),
						then open your eyes
						when you’re ready.

				<h2>Using chakra stones</h2>
				<p class="article-text">
					Meditation stones are an
					ancient technique for
					releasing negative feelings
					and attachments. As the name
					suggests, they can be used to
					unblock subtle energy blocks
					that may prevent you from
					living a passionate and
					rhythmic life. Meditation
					stones work by stimulating
					different chakras, which have
					been linked to emotional and
					physical bodily issues in your
					life.
					<br /><br />
					To use meditation stones
					effectively, meditate with
					them or hold them to each
					location of your body’s chakra
					points while concentrating on
					the stone's vibration
					frequency until you achieve
					balance. This is also helpful
					as a tool before sleep for
					deep relaxation when
					challenging emotions arise.
					<br /><br />

					Using a combination of styles,
					shapes, and colors from some
					powerful stones like quartz
					crystal points or black
					tourmaline crystals can aid in
					meditating by creating the
					right environment for deeper
					connections with difficult
					issues.
					<br /><br />

					This type of use would help
					with healing imbalances or
					blockages that might occur
					within one's life, psyche,
					spiritual consciousness or
					health.
