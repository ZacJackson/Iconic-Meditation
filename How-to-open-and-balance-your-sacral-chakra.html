					<h2>
						The
						<span
							>Sacral
							Chakra:</span
						>
						What is it?
					</h2>

					<p>
						The sacral chakra is
						the second of seven
						major energy centers
						in the body. Also
						known as the
						Svadhisthana which
						when translated
						means the “dwelling
						place of the self”.
						<br /><br />
						It governs our
						creative expression,
						sexuality and
						relationships. This
						is where we feel
						joy, pleasure and
						connection to
						others.

						<br /><br />

						Our creativity can
						be expressed through
						playfulness or by
						creating something
						new such as a
						painting or recipe.
						<br /><br />

						Everybody has this
						chakra but it will
						be stronger for some
						than for others
						depending on what
						stage of life they
						are at. In addition,
						its potency also
						depends on factors
						such as diet,
						exercise and the way
						you manage your
						thought and emotonal
						processes.
						<br /><br />

						For example a
						teenager might not
						yet have strong
						connections with
						other people so
						their sacral chakra
						will be less
						developed than
						someone who has just
						started dating
						someone new.
						<br /><br />

						The sacral chakra
						also rules our
						sexual organs so
						when it is out of
						balance it can lead
						to sexual
						dysfunction,
						depression,
						fearfulness or a
						lack of creativity.

					<h2>
						Meditation and Vam
						Chanting to balance
						the
						<span
							>Sacral
							Chakra
						</span>
					</h2>
					<p>
						Opening and
						balancing this
						chakra means letting
						go of negative
						thought patterns
						that create
						excessive feelings
						of resentment and
						bitterness. Overtime
						you will begin to
						feel a greater sense
						of belonging and
						connectedness to the
						world around you and
						those residing in it
						along side of you.
						<br /><br />
						Because this area is
						known to govern our
						emotional states,
						balancing the energy
						in this area will
						help you to become
						more tolerant of
						offences and less
						susceptible to mood
						swings and extreme
						outbursts of anger.
						You will not become
						distraught when
						dealing with the
						emotion of grief and
						the loss of loved
						ones because you
						will be more in
						touch with your
						emotional being.

					</div><br><br>
					<p>
						Meditation stones
						are an ancient
						technique for
						releasing negative
						feelings and
						attachments. As the
						name suggests, they
						can be used to
						unblock subtle
						energy blocks that
						may prevent you from
						living a passionate
						and rhythmic life.
						Meditation stones
						work by stimulating
						different chakras,
						which have been
						linked to emotional
						and physical bodily
						issues in your life.
					</p>
					<p>
						To use meditation
						stones effectively,
						meditate with them
						or hold them to each
						location of your
						body’s chakra points
						while concentrating
						on the stone's
						vibration frequency
						until you achieve
						balance. This is
						also helpful as a
						tool before sleep
						for deep relaxation
						when challenging
						emotions arise.
					</p>
					

					<p>
						Using a combination
						of styles, shapes,
						and colors from some
						powerful stones like
						quartz crystal
						points or black
						tourmaline crystals
						can aid in
						meditating by
						creating the right
						environment for
						deeper connections
						with difficult
						issues.
					</p>
					<p>
						This type of use
						would help with
						healing imbalances
						or blockages that
						might occur within
						one's life, psyche,
						spiritual
						consciousness or
						health.

					<p>
						Once the sacral

						is flowing through
						it freely it is
						possible for the
						flow of that energy
						to become
						imbalanced. A number

						take place such as
						an unhealthy diet,
						or poor regulation
						of your emotions.
						Opening the sacral
						chakra does not mean
						that it will stay

						nurtured and
						constantly taken
