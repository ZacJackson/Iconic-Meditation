						The
						<span

							Chakra:</span
						>
						What is it?
					</h2>

					<p>
						The third-eye chakra is
						the sixth of seven
						major energy centers
						in the body. Also
						known as the
						ajna which
						when translated
						means the “the Command center”.
						<br /><br />
						A balanced third-eye chakra can mean that your psychic abilities are intact. Some have the ability to leave their body at will while others have the ability to use ESP (extra sensory perception) to communicate using thoughts. There are many psychic abilities that one can obtain through balancing the third eye chakra, especially with meditation.

						<br /><br />

						Everyday we are presented with opportunities to balance out our third eye chakra but it's best to be clear about why you want to do so. Intuiton is one of the greatest gifts that we as humamn beings possess. It alerts us to danger and directs us in the path of prosperity and truth.
						<br /><br />

						

The third-eye chakra is an important energy center that can be blocked by a variety of things such as anger, overthinking and doubt. If your third-eye chakra is blocked it can lead to feeling frustrated, sad, angry. The good news is that you have the power to unblock your third-eye chakra through self-love, meditation, healthy diet, exercise and being with those you love. Keep reading if you'd like to hear how meditation can help you to open your third eye so that you can stay woke.

					<h2>
						Meditation and O-M
						Chanting to balance
						the
						<span
							>third-eye
							Chakra
						</span>
					</h2>
					<p>
						When I first opened my third eye I had been meditating and following a healthy diet for about 2-3 months. I was meditating every day from 5 minutes up to half n hour on other days. I entered into a deep trance and saw what appeared to be a lotus rotating in mid air with a bright yellow gem protruding from the middle of it. I could go into detail but I'll keep this post limited to the third eye chakra alone.
						<br /><br />
						When this centre is underactive or blocked we may find it difficult to feel motivated because our aability to exercise discernment effectively is inhibited. When our intuitive ability is blocked we may find it hard to muster up the mental energy to give ourselves a sense of direction throughout the day. There fore we find ourselves just "going with the flow". Follow this meditation and it will help you to open your third eye chakra.

							Take a

							recite the
							mantra "I

						</li>
						<li>
							Notice the
							thoughts
							that come
							and go.
							Let them
							drift into
							the void
							of
							nothingness.
							Refrain
							from
							attaching
							to them,
							just
							notice and
							accept
							that they
							are there.
							Notice the

							feel.
							Don't
							become
							attached
							to the
							feeling.
							Just
							notice the
							feeling
							and accept
							that it is
							a part of
							you.
						</li>
						<li>
							Bring your
							attention
							to your
							third-eye
							region
							where your
							third-eye
							chakra is
							located.
							Pay
							attention
							to the
							physical
							sensation
							around
							that area.
							As you
							take
							another
							deep
							breath in,
							exhale
							with a
							deep long
							'O-M-M-M-M'
							chant.
							This
							vibration
							will
							stimualte
							the third-eye
							region.
							Exhale til
							you feel
							comfortable.
						</li>
						<li>
							Each time
							you
							perform
							this chant
							imagine
							that you
							are
							letting go
							of
							feelings and thoughts of doubt
							with
							every
							exhale and
							that you
							are
							breathing
							in positive pranic
							energy to
							that
							region
							with every
							inhale.
						</li>
						<li>
							Repeat
							this for
							up to five
							minutes a
							day. When your third eye opens there will be no mistaking it. You may consider this experience to be profound but as you progress and become better at doing it you wll realise that it is part of your natural state.

					</div><br><br>
					<p>
						Meditation stones
						are an ancient
						technique for
						releasing negative
						feelings and
						attachments. As the
						name suggests, they
						can be used to
						unblock subtle
						energy blocks that
						may prevent you from
						living a passionate
						and rhythmic life.
						Meditation stones
						work by stimulating
						different chakras,
						which have been
						linked to emotional
						and physical bodily
						issues in your life.
					</p>
					<p>
						To use meditation
						stones effectively,
						meditate with them
						or hold them to each
						location of your
						body’s chakra points
						while concentrating
						on the stone's
						vibration frequency
						until you achieve
						balance. This is
						also helpful as a
						tool before sleep
						for deep relaxation
						when challenging
						emotions arise.
					</p>
					

					<p>
						Using a combination
						of styles, shapes,
						and colors from some
						powerful stones like
						quartz crystal
						points or black
						tourmaline crystals
						can aid in
						meditating by
						creating the right
						environment for
						deeper connections
						with difficult
						issues.
					</p>
					<p>
						This type of use
						would help with
						healing imbalances
						or blockages that
						might occur within
						one's life, psyche,
						spiritual
						consciousness or
						health.

					<p>
						Once the third-eye

						unblocked and energy
						is flowing through
						it freely it is
						possible for the
						flow of that energy
						to become
						imbalanced. A number
						of factors can cause
						this imbalance to
						take place such as
						an unhealthy diet,
						or poor regulation
						of your emotions.
						Opening the third-eye
						chakra does not mean
						that it will stay

						nurtured and
						constantly taken

						ensure that an
