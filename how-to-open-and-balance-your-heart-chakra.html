					<h2>
						The
						<span
							>heart
							Chakra:</span
						>
						What is it?
					</h2>

					<p>
						The heart chakra is
						the fourth of seven
						major energy centers
						in the body. Also
						known as the
						Anahata which
						when translated
						means the “Unhurt”.
						<br /><br />
						Feelings such as anger, jealousy, low self-esteem are all signs that your heart chakra might need some attention. Luckily there are many ways to help heal this area so you can feel more fulfilled and grounded in your life again!

						<br /><br />

						Our ability to practice love can be expressed through the way we interact with the environment aroud us. Practising love doesn't just mean loving other people, it also means loving yourself and the world around you.
						<br /><br />

						Everybody has this
						chakra but it will
						be stronger for some
						than for others
						depending on what
						stage of life they
						are at. In addition,
						its potency also
						depends on factors
						such as diet,
						exercise and the way
						you manage your
						thought and emotonal
						processes.
						<br /><br />

						For example a
						teenager might not
						yet have strong
						connections with
						other people so
						their heart chakra
						will be less
						developed than
						someone who has just
						started dating
						someone new.
						<br /><br />

						This chakra is a symbol of love and self-love. You are never alone in this world, even when you feel as if nobody cares about you or that no one understands your feelings. Let the heart center create space for healing while cleansing the negative energies away with meditation and breathing techniques

						Meditation and Y-A-M
						Chanting to balance
						the
						<span
							>Heart
							Chakra
						</span>
					</h2>
					<p>
						Opening and
						balancing this
						chakra means letting
						go of negative
						thought patterns
						that create
						excessive feelings
						of resentment, jealousy,
						bitterness and malice. It means learning to make righteous judgements based on behaviour rather then factors such as the outter appearance or ethnicity.
						<br /><br />
						Because this area is
						known to govern our
						emotional states,
						balancing the energy
						in this area will
						help you to become
						more tolerant of
						offences and less
						susceptible to mood
						swings and extreme
						outbursts of anger.
						You will not become
						distraught when
						dealing with the
						emotion of grief and
						the loss of loved
						ones because you
						will be more in
						touch with your
						emotional being.

					</div><br><br>
					<p>
						Meditation stones
						are an ancient
						technique for
						releasing negative
						feelings and
						attachments. As the
						name suggests, they
						can be used to
						unblock subtle
						energy blocks that
						may prevent you from
						living a passionate
						and rhythmic life.
						Meditation stones
						work by stimulating
						different chakras,
						which have been
						linked to emotional
						and physical bodily
						issues in your life.
					</p>
					<p>
						To use meditation
						stones effectively,
						meditate with them
						or hold them to each
						location of your
						body’s chakra points
						while concentrating
						on the stone's
						vibration frequency
						until you achieve
						balance. This is
						also helpful as a
						tool before sleep
						for deep relaxation
						when challenging
						emotions arise.
					</p>
					

					<p>
						Using a combination
						of styles, shapes,
						and colors from some
						powerful stones like
						quartz crystal
						points or black
						tourmaline crystals
						can aid in
						meditating by
						creating the right
						environment for
						deeper connections
						with difficult
						issues.
					</p>
					<p>
						This type of use
						would help with
						healing imbalances
						or blockages that
						might occur within
						one's life, psyche,
						spiritual
						consciousness or
						health.

						Once the heart
