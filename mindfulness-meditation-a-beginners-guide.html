					<h3>Comfortability</h3>
					<p >
					Sitting in a seated position with
					your legs crossed or both feet
					flat on the floor is always helpful when it comes to meditation. This will
					help to prevent you from
					falling asleep and
					keeping your spine straight. If you have issues
					with keeping your spine
					straight then it's also ok to
					sit or lie in a position where
					you feel comforatable.</p>

						<h3>Environment</h3>
				<p>
					Finding a comfortable place to
					meditate is always helpful when starting out with meditation. If possible, I highly recommend finding a quiet spot out in nature or somewhere outside among the elements and the abundance of life that thrives outdoors.</p>	
					
					<p>			
						As you begin to familiarize yourself with meditation you will gain an awareness of sounds and how they contribute to both distraction and growth. For exapmle, certain noises can make you feel highly irritable while others, like soft music or birds chirping can make you feel relaxed.
					</p>
					<h4>key points</h4>
					<ul class="key-points">
					<li>
						Sit somewhere that
						helps you to relax and feel at peace.
					</li>
					<li>
						Meditate in a place or at a time where distractions have been minimized.
					</li>
					<li>
						Surround yourself with energies (i.e. natural elements, plants etc), objects and sounds (i.e. frequencies and vibrations) that help you to feel balanced and calm.

			<h3>Breathing</h3>
			<p >
				Deep breathing is at the heart of meditation. Breathing exercises are designed to help our brain function at optimal performance. such exercises send oxygen to the brain and to your blood cells which help to lower stress levels.
				
			</p>
			<p>
				Many practitioners have come and gone over the years and have emphasised the importance of deep <a href="https://www.beliefnet.com/wellness/articles/pranic-breathing-the-key-to-both-relaxation-and-energy.aspx">pranic breathing</a>. The term pranic breathing can be summed up as the  breathing in of pure life force energy.  
				</p>
				<p>
					This is one of the main reasons that breathing is at the heart of meditation. Breathing helps to attune the body and bring it into a state of balance and equilibrium. Moreover, there are types of movement meditation known as tai-chi, yoga and qi-gong that also place a heavy emphasis on breath control. Not only does controlled breathing imrove your mental and emotional state it can also improve your physical well-being. </p>

						
						<h4>key points</h4>
						<ul class="key-points">
							<li>
								Breathing is the fundamental basis of all meditation.
					</li>
					<li>
						Breath-work helps to maximise the benefits of meditation.
					</li>
					<li>
						Focusing on your breath while learning to meditate will help you to stay focused and present.
					</li>
					<li>
						Pranic breathing delivers oxygen to every cell in your body.
					</li>
					<li>
						There are movement meditation practices called yoga, tai-chi and qi-gong.

				<h3>Focus</h3>
				<p>
					Many people can tell you from experience with meditation that meditation mingled with a consistent attitude improved their mental capacities over time. Especially, when it came to developing a mind that is able to focus for longer periods of time.
				</p>
				<p>
					Among many of the <a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/mental-health/types-of-meditation">meditation styles</a>, mindfulness meditation in particular helps you to practice staying focused for longer periods by helping you to stay present. It is a type of brain conditioning that re-wires an easily distracted mind and makes your ability to focus laser sharp.</p>
					<p>
						Attention span is an extremely important aspect to consider in todays world with the uprise of advanced technology and artificial intelligence. Putting aside time once or twice a day to sharpen your mental faculties is a must if you want to out do the negative influence of modern day technology.
					</p>
					<p>
						Meditation can help you to stay focused in the most and at the least expected of times. The sharper your ability to focus becomes the more adept you become to noticing things in your environment that you may not have noticed otherwise. And there is also a possibility that these things will be of a spiritual nature.
					</p>
					
				<h4>key points</h4>
				<ul class="key-points">
					<li>
						Meditation helps to increase your ability to focus for longer periods of time.
					</li>
					<li>
						Mindfulness meditation in particualr is a type of re-conditioning of your mind.
					</li>
					<li>
						A mind that is easily distracted can be reconditioned through regular practice of mindfulness meditation.

				<h3>Time management</h3>
				<p >
					When people are first starting to learn meditation, one question they always have to ask is 'how long should I meditate for?'. 
				</p>
				<p>
					The first thing I would recommend is to tune in and listen to what your physical body is saying. Never allow yourself to become mentally fatigued. Don't sit for long periods if your body is not use to it. 
</p>
<p>			When I first taught myself to meditate I would start with short periods and would find that my mind could not focus for periods longer then 10 seconds (yes, like a goldfish lol). Overtime as I became consistent with my practice ten seconds transformed into ten minutes. And ten minutes of mindfulness a day is sufficient for anyone learning how to integrate mindfulness into their daily routine. 
				</p>
				<h4>key points</h4>
				
				<ul class="key-points">
					<li>
						The body needs time to transition into a lifestyle of meditation from both a physical and psychological perspective.
					</li>
					<li>
						Start with small time frames from anywhere in between 2- 5 mins then gradually increase your time limit as your mind and body become accustomed to meditation. In contrast, try not to limit yourself with timeframes as they could become a negative distraction.
					</li>
					<li>
						A timer with an alarm set time limits for your self. Especially for those living on a tight schedule.
					</li>

					<h2>Attention</h2>
					<p >
						If you’re interested
						in
								mindfulness
									meditation
									, I
						recommend looking
						into the benefits of
						using
						<a href="https://www.headspace.com/mindfulness">guided
							meditations</a>
						 and
						 other mindfulness
						 techniques
						 .
						</p>
						<h2>Interest</h2>
					<p>
						Mindfulness
						meditation is a simple practice
						that
						you can do at any
						time. You don’t need
						to be sitting in the
						lotus position on
						top of a mountain
						somewhere in the
						wilderness; all you
						need is 5 minutes
						per day to start
						reaping the rewards
						it offers!
						Overall you’ll be
						able to reduce
						stress and improve
						your health by entering into the <a href="https://21735lk6o1seyl0x2ephsd-wen.hop.clickbank.net/?cbpage=breathing-in-flow">flow state</a>.
					</p>
					<h2>Desire</h2>
					<p >
						The world can be an
						overwhelming place
						sometimes and being
						able to take some
						time out of our busy
						lives and just
						breathe deeply can
						help us feel more
						relaxed about life’s
						challenges.
					</p>
					<p>
						Mindfulness
						meditation allows us
						to see things from a
						different
						perspective – one
						where we are not so
						attached to outcomes
						or results but
						rather focused on
						what we have control
						over right now (our <a href="https://d0923un6q9lc1jr68fvptkntcj.hop.clickbank.net/?cbpage=breathing-in-flow">breathing</a>
						).
</p>
<p>
	This helps us stay
						calm even when faced
						with difficult
						situations because
						we know that
						everything will pass
						eventually and there
						is nothing we can do
						about it anyway!
					</p>
					<p>						
							We learn how to let
							go of stress by
						practicing mindful
						living every day
						through simple
						activities like
						eating mindfully or
						taking deep breaths
						before responding
						emotionally during
						conflicts with loved
						ones/friends/colleagues
						etc.
					</p>
					<h2>Action</h2>
					<p >
						Taking action now is a sure way to improve your well-being and overall health. Get started today. Don't let thoughts and emotions hold you back from reaching your full potential.

						How to integrate <span>mindfulness</span>

						 your life-style.
						</h2>
						<p>
							Research indicates
							that a vast majority
							of our behavior is
							influenced by <a href="https://www.verywellmind.com/what-are-negative-automatic-thoughts-3024608">automatic thinking.</a>
							
							When we think we are
							doing something new,
							our brain is
							actually defaulting
							to old habits.
						</p>
						<p>
							These default brain
							signals are so
							efficient that they
							often cause us to
							relapse into old
							behaviors before we
							remember what we
							were meant to do.
						</p>
						<p>
							It’s unfortunate
							because these
							thoughts can be
							extremely
							detrimental for
						one’s health and
						wellness, but
						luckily, there is a
						way of stopping them
						in their tracks.
					</p>
					<p>
						The more chances we
						get to activate the
						intentional brain
						the better. Putting <a href="https://www.instagram.com/iconic_meditation/">meditation reminders</a>
						
						around you and in
						your living
						environment remind
						you to be present.
					</p>
					<p>
						Refreshing your
						reminders regularly
						helps to create new
						connections in the
						brain. This will
						help you to create
						new thinking
						patterns which help
						to boost creativity
						and problem solving.
					</p>
					<p>
						If you really want
						to quiet your mind
						and be more creative
						the next time you’re
						trying to come up
						with a solution for
						your work-related
						problem, try using
						mindfulness as an
						aid.
					</p>
					<p>
						By putting reminders
						around yourself
						(such as on a desk,
						in the kitchen, or
						on your phone
						screen), it will
						make it much easier
						to make mindfulness
						a regular habit.

	By learning to be present, we learn to be more aware of what is happening with regard to our thought processes. 
	
	By allowing the mind to be still, we open our self up to receive external information from our surroundings. With the release of new solutions, we are able to come up with more creative and helpful ways to solve problems.

Meditation music can help bring your mind into a deep state of relaxation while meditating and can help you to immensely sharpen your focus. Furthermore, the frequencies and vibrations that <a href="https://youtu.be/6HyeAKg8Y_s">meditation music</a> radiates are known to influence your own vibrational frequency at a genetic level!

		<h2>
			Obstacles for <span>Mindfulness Meditation.</span> 
		</h2>
		<p >
			There are many obstacles which are presented when practicing mindfulness but they should not be seen as barriers but rather as growth opportunities which will help you overcome them. The key premise of mindfulness meditation is to keep bringing your mind back to the present moment.
			It’s about learning from your emotions during practice and then controlling them when you’re not practicing.
		</p>
		<p>
			With mindfulness meditation, it is necessary to take on a new mind set. When we remove our attentional blinkers and ‘notice where they go’ it becomes easier to accept that reality doesn’t usually happen in a nice neat way but instead trickles into us gradually through waves of feedback loops between cognition, sensing, feeling.
		</p>
		<p>
			Mindfulness meditation is a powerful tool for anyone who desires to find peace and serenity. It may take some time before you start feeling the effects, but once they come in full swing, you’ll be hooked. The obstacles that arise shouldn’t deter you; rather, see them as growth opportunities that will only make your practice stronger with time!
			
		</p>
		<p class="key-points">
			
		</p>
		<h4>
			Key Points:
		</h4>
		
		<ul class="key-points">
			<li>
				<span class="list-span">
					Distractions are opportunities for growth:
				</span>
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
 Take note of distractions and notice the way your emotions respond to them. Notice the thought patterns that arise in your mind and how they contribute to your emotional state. Do you feel agitated? Irritated? Restless? Does your ability to focus subside? Is your response to the distraction/s a healthy one? Remember, being mindful is not about controlling ourselves and the world around us, it’s about being present and immersed in the moment.
</p>
<p>
	I know you're probably skeptical about mindfulness meditation. It's really not that much of a hassle, all it requires is some time and patience to help clear your mind from the stresses in life so that we can focus on what matters most: our mental health.
	<br><br>
	Mindfulness meditation doesn't ask for anything fancy, just yourself with an open heart and receptive spirit! We only have one body but two minds which means there are always going to be competing interests vying for attention - something has got to give or else stress will start taking its toll on us mentally as well as physically. That's why I signed up at today is a good time to start.
	I hope you enjoyed readig this short article about mindfulness meditation.

<p>
	Namaste
