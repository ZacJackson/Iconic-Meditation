						The
						<span

							Chakra:</span

						What is it?
					</h2>

					<p>
						The crown chakra is the 7th and last major energy centre in the body. This chakra governs our spiritual connection, sense of independence, intuition and out-of-body experiences. It is also associated with the pineal gland which controls our hormones as well as releasing melatonin to help regulate sleep cycles.

						<br /><br />
						A balanced crown chakra can mean that your abilty to utilise cosmic energy to your advantage is optimal. For instance, being in touch with your divine nature can help you to see and understand things that have been and that are to come from a much deeper and spiritual point of view.

						<br /><br />

						Everyday we are presented with opportunities to balance out our crown chakra but it's best to be clear about why you want to do so. Accesing your divine nature while operating in the physical realm can make your journey athrough life alot more insightful and fulfilling.
						<br /><br />

						

The crown chakra is an important energy center that can be blocked by a variety of things such as anger, overthinking and doubt. If your crown chakra is blocked it can lead to feeling frustrated, sad, angry and without a sese of purpose. The good news is that you have the power to unblock your crown chakra through self-love, meditation, healthy diet, exercise and being with those you love. Keep reading if you'd like to hear how meditation can help you to open your third eye so that you can stay woke.

						Meditation and O-M
						Chanting to balance
						the
						<span
							>crown
							Chakra
						</span>
					</h2>
					<p>
						The crown chakra is the last chakra to be fully activated. This can lead people to feel disconnected from themselves and others, which can cause them to turn their attention outward in search of purpose or meaning. Sensitivity is another symptom that comes with an underactive crown chakra.
						<br /><br />
						

Fortunately, there are many ways you can activate your crown chakra! One way is through meditation- when practicing mindfulness, it’s easy for our minds to become distracted by all the thoughts we have floating around. Instead of trying so hard not to think about anything (which often makes us more aware of how much we actually do), try giving yourself a specific focus for your meditation like saying a prayer or repeating a mantra.

                            "From death, lead me into everlasting life"
                            <br><br>
						</li>
						<li>
							Notice the

							that come
							and go.
							Let them
							drift into
							the void
							of
							nothingness.
							Refrain
							from
							attaching
							to them,
							just
							notice and
							accept
							that they
							are there.
							Notice the
							way you
							feel.
							Don't
							become
							attached
							to the
							feeling.
							Just
							notice the
							feeling
							and accept
							that it is
							a part of
							you.
						</li>
						<li>
							Bring your
							attention
							to your
							crown
							region
							where your
							crown
							chakra is
							located.
							Pay
							attention
							to the
							physical
							sensation
							around
							that area.
							As you
							take
							another
							deep
							breath in,
							exhale
							with a
							deep long
							'O-M-M-M-M'
							chant.
							This
							vibration
							will
							stimualte
							the crown
							region.
							Exhale til
							you feel
							comfortable.
						</li>
						<li>
							Each time
							you
							perform

							imagine
							that you
							are
							letting go
							of
							feelings and thoughts of doubt
							with

							exhale and
							that you
							are

						</li>
						<li>
							Repeat
							this for
							up to five
							minutes a
							day. When your third eye opens there will be no mistaking it. You may consider this experience to be profound but as you progress and become better at doing it you wll realise that it is part of your natural state.

					</div><br><br>
					<p>
						Meditation stones
						are an ancient
						technique for
						releasing negative
						feelings and
						attachments. As the
						name suggests, they
						can be used to
						unblock subtle
						energy blocks that
						may prevent you from
						living a passionate
						and rhythmic life.
						Meditation stones
						work by stimulating
						different chakras,
						which have been
						linked to emotional
						and physical bodily
						issues in your life.
					</p>
					<p>
						To use meditation
						stones effectively,
						meditate with them
						or hold them to each
						location of your
						body’s chakra points
						while concentrating
						on the stone's
						vibration frequency
						until you achieve
						balance. This is
						also helpful as a
						tool before sleep
						for deep relaxation
						when challenging
						emotions arise.
					</p>
					

					<p>
						Using a combination
						of styles, shapes,
						and colors from some
						powerful stones like
						quartz crystal
						points or black
						tourmaline crystals
						can aid in
						meditating by
						creating the right
						environment for
						deeper connections
						with difficult
						issues.
					</p>
					<p>
						This type of use
						would help with
						healing imbalances
						or blockages that
						might occur within
						one's life, psyche,
						spiritual
						consciousness or
						health.

					<p>
						Once the crown

						to become
						imbalanced. A number

						an unhealthy diet,
						or poor regulation
						of your emotions.
						Opening the crown

						constantly taken
