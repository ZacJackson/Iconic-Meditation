						The solar plexus

						It is also known as

						and has a deep

						are, this centre
						will be strong and

<h2>
    Opening <span>solar plexus chakra</span> with meditation. 
</h2>
<p>
Meditation can be a tricky thing for the mind. There are many styles of meditation, and different concepts pursued by each discipline all to teach us a similar lesson. To live in the present moment, fully understanding all that is going on within it. But what happens when we lose our self-awareness? That's where meditation for the solar plexus steps in to lead you back through your personal journey into yourself─ balancing and unblocking this chakra along the way.
</p>
<p>
    Opening and balancing the solar plexus chakra means allowing yourself to become more confident and courageous in the face of fear. The key to creating a balance is allowing this energy to flow through your naturally and freely without allowing it to cause you to become overconfident and cocky.  
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
Sit in a comfortable position (prefereably the lotus or the half lotus postition) with your back straight. Take a deep breath in then recite the mantra "I am in control of my thought san emotions". 
    </li>
    <li>
        Notice the thoughts that come and go. Let them drift into the void of nothingness. Refrain from attaching to them, just notice and accept that they are there. Notice the way you feel. Don't become attached to the feeling. Just notice the feeling and accept that it is a part of you.  
    </li>
    <li>
        Bring your attention to your the region where your solar plexus is located. Pay attention to the physical sensation around that area. As you take another deep breath in, exhale with a deep long 'R-a-a-a-a-m' chant (make sure to flick the tongue when chanting with the 'R'). This vibration will stimualte the solar plexus. Exhale til you feel comfortable. 
    </li>
    <li>
        Each time you perform this chant imagine that you are letting go of negative energy from that area with every exhale and that you are breathing in pranic energy to that region with every inhale. 
    </li>
    <li>
        Repeat this for up to five minutes a day until you start to notice changes in your ability to expres yourself and be assertive. 
    </li>
</ol>

					<h2>
						Keeping your

						</span>
						balanced
					</h2>
					<p>
						The Solar Plexus Chakra is the center of physical and emotional power. It rules our individual goals, ambitions, and desires for independence and self-determination. There are many things that can block this chakra including fear, pride and resentment. 

A person with this blocked will focus on their own needs to a point where they become focused only on themselves. They're afraid of what the world has to offer so they stay in their comfort zone as long as possible before making any social interaction or changing careers; these people may also have a tendency to be self-centered or need excessive attention just from others around them because they lack self worth - it's not uncommon.

					<h2>Using

					<div>

					</div><br><br>
					<p>
						Meditation stones
						are an ancient
						technique for
						releasing negative
						feelings and
						attachments. As the
						name suggests, they
						can be used to
						unblock subtle
						energy blocks that
						may prevent you from
						living a passionate
						and rhythmic life.
						Meditation stones
						work by stimulating
						different chakras,
						which have been
						linked to emotional
						and physical bodily
						issues in your life.
					</p>
					<p>
						To use meditation
						stones effectively,
						meditate with them
						or hold them to each
						location of your
						body’s chakra points
						while concentrating
						on the stone's
						vibration frequency
						until you achieve
						balance. This is
						also helpful as a
						tool before sleep
						for deep relaxation
						when challenging
						emotions arise.
					</p>
					

					<p>
						Using a combination
						of styles, shapes,
						and colors from some
						powerful stones like
						quartz crystal
						points or black
						tourmaline crystals
						can aid in
						meditating by
						creating the right
						environment for
						deeper connections
						with difficult
						issues.
					</p>
					<p>
						This type of use
						would help with
						healing imbalances
						or blockages that
						might occur within
						one's life, psyche,
						spiritual
						consciousness or
						health.
