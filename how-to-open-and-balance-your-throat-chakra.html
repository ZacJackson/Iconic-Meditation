						The
						<span

							Chakra:</span
						>
						What is it?
					</h2>

					<p>
						The throat chakra is
						the fifth of seven
						major energy centers
						in the body. Also
						known as the
						vishudda which
						when translated
						means the “the purifier”.
						<br /><br />
						A balanced throat chakra can mean self-expression without fear of rejection, openness to new ideas and experiences, being able to communicate your thoughts and feelings clearly which leads to a healthy self-esteem.

						<br /><br />

						Everyday we are faced with challenges that can be draining or difficult to deal with alone, but by opening up about our struggles and talking through them, we find strength beyond ourselves. We gain wisdom from others' experiences and advice which helps us find peace no matter how chaotic life gets. 
						<br /><br />

						

The throat chakra is an important energy center that can be blocked by a variety of things such as anger, sorrow, and fear. If your throat chakra is blocked it can lead to feeling frustrated, sad or angry. The good news is that you have the power to unblock your throat chakra through self-love and meditation.

					<div>

					</div><br><br>
					<p>
						Meditation stones
						are an ancient
						technique for
						releasing negative
						feelings and
						attachments. As the
						name suggests, they
						can be used to
						unblock subtle
						energy blocks that
						may prevent you from
						living a passionate
						and rhythmic life.
						Meditation stones
						work by stimulating
						different chakras,
						which have been
						linked to emotional
						and physical bodily
						issues in your life.
					</p>
					<p>
						To use meditation
						stones effectively,
						meditate with them
						or hold them to each
						location of your
						body’s chakra points
						while concentrating
						on the stone's
						vibration frequency
						until you achieve
						balance. This is
						also helpful as a
						tool before sleep
						for deep relaxation
						when challenging
						emotions arise.
					</p>
					

					<p>
						Using a combination
						of styles, shapes,
						and colors from some
						powerful stones like
						quartz crystal
						points or black
						tourmaline crystals
						can aid in
						meditating by
						creating the right
						environment for
						deeper connections
						with difficult
						issues.
					</p>
					<p>
						This type of use
						would help with
						healing imbalances
						or blockages that
						might occur within
						one's life, psyche,
						spiritual
						consciousness or
						health.

					<p>
						Once the throat
						chakra has become
						unblocked and energy
						is flowing through
						it freely it is
						possible for the
						flow of that energy
						to become
						imbalanced. A number
						of factors can cause
						this imbalance to
						take place such as
						an unhealthy diet,
						or poor regulation
						of your emotions.
						Opening the throat
						chakra does not mean
						that it will stay
						open. It must be
						tended to like a
						garden and be
						nurtured and
						constantly taken
						care of in order to
						ensure that an
