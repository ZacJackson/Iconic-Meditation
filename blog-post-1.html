					Meditation 101: Getting to
					know the basics.
				</h2>
				<h3>Comfortability</h3>
				<p>
					Sit in a seated position with
					your legs crossed or both feet
					flat on the floor. This will
					help to prevent you from
					falling asleep and with
					keeping your spine in an erect
					position (if that is
					possible). If you have issues
					with keeping your spine
					straight then it is also ok to
					sit or lie in a position where
					you feel as comfortable as you
					can.

					possible). If you have issues
					with keeping your spine
					straight then it is also ok to
					sit or lie in a position where
					you feel as comfortable as you
					can.
				</p>
				<h4>key points</h4>
				<ul class="key-points">
					<li>
						Wear comfortable
						clothing.
					</li>
					<li>
						Sit in a comfortable
						position.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<br />
				<p class="divider"></p>
				<h3>Environment</h3>
				<p>
					Find a comfortable place to
					sit where you won’t be
					distracted. And bare in mind
					that thoughts and physical
					sensations, such as an itch
					can be distracting. Overtime
					as you get better at
					meditating small distractions
					become anchors which will help
					you to progress with the
					practice of meditation.
				</p>
				<p>
					Overtime as you begin to
					master mindfulness meditation
					you will find it easier to
					meditate in, and around the
					presence of noise. Remember
					that you have an internal
					environment as well as an
					external environment. Our aim
					is to work on our internal
					environment in order for our
					mind’s to change the way we
					interact with the external
					environment.
				</p>
				<h4>key points</h4>
				<ul class="key-points">
					<li>
						Sit somewhere that
						helps you to relax
					</li>
					<li>
						Sit where
						distractions are
						minimal.
					</li>
					<li>
						Your internal
						environment
						determines your
						external one.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<br />
				<p class="divider"></p>
				<p></p>
				<h3>Breathing</h3>
				<p>
					Take a deep breath in slowly
					through your nostrils until
					you feel your diaphragm fill
					with oxygen (prana). Slowly
					exhale through your mouth. Let
					out as much air as you can but
					do not force it.
					<br /><br />
					Let it flow naturally. Repeat
					this exercise 3-5 times until
					you feel relaxed. Once you
					have completed 3-5 cycles
					allow yourself to breathe
					normally. You can achieve this
					by bringing your attention
					away from the breath and into
					the mind to observe.
					<br /><br />
					Notice how certain thoughts
					influence the rate at which
					you breathe. Some increase
					your heart rate and others
					slow it down. Stay focused on
					observing thoughts and
					feelings rather then attaching
					to them. Breathe naturally and
					try to stay relaxed.
					<br /><br />
					Come back to the breath when
					your mind drifts. Utilize deep
					breathing to bring your self
					into a relaxed state and back
					into the present moment. A
					calm mind produces positive
					results.
				</p>
				<h4>key points</h4>
				<ul class="key-points">
					<li>
						Breathe all the way
						in until your
						diaphragm fills with
						air (prana) then
						exhale through your
						nose.
					</li>
					<li>
						Breathe deeply until
						your mind is relaxed
						then start to let
						your breathing
						happen naturally.
					</li>
					<li>
						Stay focused on
						breathing as you
						inhale and exhale.
					</li>
					<li>
						Focus on your breath
						which will help you
						to be present and in
						the moment.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<br /><br />
				<p class="divider"></p>
				<h3>Focus</h3>
				<p>
					Pay very close attention to
					your breath as you inhale and
					exhale. Notice the air going
					in and out. As you draw your
					attention towards yourself
					breathing notice the thoughts
					coming into the forefront of
					your mind. Pay attention to
					how these thoughts make you
					feel.
					<br /><br />
					Acknowledge your emotional
					state. Let them arise then
					subside. Refrain from
					attaching to any thought that
					causes your emotions to
					charge. Just observe and
					become aware of the patterns
					in your mind.

					<br /><br />
					Notice any physical sensation
					that occurs. If you need to
					scratch and itch then feel
					free to scratch the itch.
					Alternatively, you may let the
					sensation go away at its own
					will. Be mindful that it takes
					practice to achieve that level
					of awareness.
					<br /><br />
				</p>
				<h4>key points</h4>
				<ul class="key-points">
					<li>
						Your mind will drift
						countless times.
						Keep coming back to
						the present moment
						by focusing on your
						breath (or something
						that your senses are
						picking up).
					</li>
					<li>
						Observe your
						thoughts, emotions
						and physical
						sensations. Notice
						the patterns in your
						mind regarding
						thoughts and
						emotions.
					</li>
					<li>
						Observe thoughts
						rather then
						attaching to, and
						thinking about them.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<br /><br />
				<p class="divider"></p>
				<h3>Time management</h3>
				<p>
					Whether it’s for ten seconds
					or 10 hours, being mindful
					will always bring you into the
					present moment away from the
					habit of drifting.
					<br /><br />

					Trust the process and try not
					attach to an outcome.
					Mindfulness can be practiced
					anytime and anywhere.
					Consistency is the key so
					regular practice, even a few
					minutes a day can have a
					profound impact on your life.

					<br /><br />
					With time comes growth. Your
					mind and body have been
					through a lot in the past. Be
					kind to yourself. It is very
					easy to become frustrated and
					give up.
					<br /><br />
					Start with small 5-10 second
					bouts of mental silence over
					3-5 minute periods throughout
					your day. Do this at least 2-3
					times a day until you’re ready
					to take it further.
				</p>
				<ul class="key-points">
					<li>
						Keep bringing your
						focus back to your
						breathing whenever
						your mind drifts.
					</li>
					<li>
						Practice for
						3-5minutes a day
						until you are
						comfortable
						extending the time
						limit.
					</li>
					<li>
						Be consistent and
						you will reap the
						reward of a more
						fulfilling and
						meaningful life.
					</li>
				</ul>

					<h2>Attention</h2>
					<p>
						If you’re interested
						in mindfulness
						meditation, I
						recommend looking
						into the benefits of
						using guided
						meditations and
						other mindfulness
						techniques.
					</p>
					<h2>Interest</h2>
					<p>
						Mindfulness
						meditation is a
						simple practice that
						you can do at any
						time. You don’t need
						to be sitting in the
						lotus position on
						top of a mountain
						out in the
						wilderness; all you
						need is 5 minutes
						per day to start
						reaping the rewards
						it offers!
						<br /><br />
						Overall you’ll be
						able to reduce
						stress and improve
						your health by
						practicing
						mindfulness
						meditation
						regularly.
					</p>
					<h2>Desire</h2>
					<p>
						The world can be an
						overwhelming place
						sometimes and being
						able to take some
						time out of our busy
						lives and just
						breathe deeply can
						help us feel more
						relaxed about life’s
						challenges.
						<br /><br />
						Mindfulness
						meditation allows us
						to see things from a
						different
						perspective – one
						where we are not so
						attached to outcomes
						or results but
						rather focused on
						what we have control
						over right now (our
						breathing).
						<br /><br />

						This helps us stay
						calm even when faced
						with difficult
						situations because
						we know that
						everything will pass
						eventually and there
						is nothing we can do
						about it anyway!
						<br /><br />

						We learn how to let
						go of stress by
						practicing mindful
						living every day
						through simple
						activities like
						eating mindfully or
						taking deep breaths
						before responding
						emotionally during
						conflicts with loved
						ones/friends/colleagues
						etc.

						sitting or walking
						quietly and without
						external
						distraction. It
						promotes emotional
