					Creating a <span>solid
						foundation</span> for your
						life.
					</h2>
					<p>
						How can you feel
						safe, stable, and
						grounded when the
						world around you
						feels unpredictable?
						It sounds like a
						paradox with no
						solution. But it
						doesn't have to be
						that way! The root
						chakra is our solid
						foundation for
						balance in life;
						without it opened we
						will struggle to
						make any progress on
						the journey upwards.
					</p>
					<p>
						In Eastern
						philosophies, this
						energy center is
						said to be located
						at the very bottom
						of the spine and
						coils around all
						other 7 chakras even
						though they are not
						in physical
						alignment.
					</p>
					<p>
						Balancing your root
						chakra creates a new
						sense of faith in
						life's upsets so
						that they don't
						bring you down and
						make you feel
						discouraged and
						unwilling to live
						life completely.
					</p>
					</section>
					<section class="foundation">
					<h2>
						Opening your<span> root
						chakra</span> with
						meditation
					</h2>
					<p>
						The root chakra is
						the first of 7 major
						chakras in our body,
						and it's all about
						grounding. It's also
						called the base or
						foundation, and it's
						responsible for
						keeping us grounded
						to Mother Earth.
					</p>

					<p>
						Many of us are not
						feeling grounded and
						full of energy. We
						may be struggling to
						feel calm, or we may
						be experiencing a
						low mood. This is
						often because our
						root chakra is not
						open which means we
						don't have enough
						life force flowing
						through us.
					</p>
					<p>
						In this blog post
						I'm going to show
						you how to open your
						root chakra so that
						you can get more
						life force flowing
						through your body!
						The root chakra is
						also the foundation
						of our energy system
						and governs how we
						receive energy from
						others. When you
						have your root
						chakra open, you are
						in a place where you
						can really feel
						what's going on with
						other people. You’re
						also more able to
						take care of
						yourself because it
						allows for
						self-honoring,
						self-love, and
						willingness to be
						alone in solitude.

							The root

							located at
							your base
							of the
							spine and
							it affects
							our sense
							of
							personal
							power,
							security,
							grounding
							and
							physical
							energy.
							The first
							step in
							opening
							this
							chakra is
							to find a
							comfortable
							position
							on the
							floor with
							legs
							crossed as
							close to
							your body
							as
							possible.
							You should
							be
							cross-legged
							with both
							feet
							tucked
							under you
							(or one
							foot if
							that's
							uncomfortable).
							Place your
							hands
							palms up
							on either
							side of
							your hips
							and take 3
							deep
							breaths
							focusing
							on letting
							go of
							negative
							thoughts
							from head

							This is
							where your
							root
							chakra is
							located.
							Notice any
							tightness
							in around
							the base
							of your
							spine.
							Since the
							root
							chakra
							element is
							fire,
							imagine
							that a
							bright red
							glowing
							light like
							an ember
							from a
							fire is
							bringing
							warmth to
							your
							entire
							being.
							Hold the
							thought
							for as
							long as
							you can
							and when
							you drift
							just
							keeping
							coming
							back to
							that same
							thought.
							let go of
							any
							negative
							thoughts
							that
							envoke
							feelings
							of fear.
							Be present
							and try to
							stay
							focused on
							the base
							of your

							the bright
							red
							glowing
							light.

					<h2>Using 
					<span>chakra stones</span> to create balance</h2>
					<div>
						<img
						src="./images/meditation-stones.jpg"
						alt="meditation stones"
						/>
					</div><br><br>
					<p>
						Meditation stones
						are an ancient
						technique for
						releasing negative
						feelings and
						attachments. As the
						name suggests, they
						can be used to
						unblock subtle
						energy blocks that
						may prevent you from
						living a passionate
						and rhythmic life.
						Meditation stones
						work by stimulating
						different chakras,
						which have been
						linked to emotional
						and physical bodily
						issues in your life.
					</p>
					<p>
						To use meditation
						stones effectively,
						meditate with them
						or hold them to each
						location of your
						body’s chakra points
						while concentrating
						on the stone's
						vibration frequency
						until you achieve
						balance. This is
						also helpful as a
						tool before sleep
						for deep relaxation
						when challenging
						emotions arise.
					</p>
					

					<p>
						Using a combination
						of styles, shapes,
						and colors from some
						powerful stones like
						quartz crystal
						points or black
						tourmaline crystals
						can aid in
						meditating by
						creating the right
						environment for
						deeper connections
						with difficult
						issues.
					</p>
					<p>
						This type of use
						would help with
						healing imbalances
						or blockages that
						might occur within
						one's life, psyche,
						spiritual
						consciousness or
						health.

	<h2>Using meditative music to balance your <span>root chakra.</span></h2>

				There are many benefits of meditation

				<p>				I highly recommend incorporating this
